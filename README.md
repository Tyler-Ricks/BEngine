# BEngine

This is a graphics engine, but I don't know how to make a graphics engine, so I
am getting a feel for it with this first before making something more serious.

The goal is to be able to use this the implement various graphcics techniques,
such as shadowmapping, transparency, PBR, etc. 

I will be using Vulkan as the graphics API, and GLFW for windowing. 

Also, I am basing parts of this off of Travis Vroman's Kohi Engine and Brendan 
Galea's littleVulkanEngine.

Since this is not a game engine, but instead a rendering engine, it should be 
somewhat different
