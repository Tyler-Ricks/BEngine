# BEngine

This is a graphics engine, but I don't know how to make a graphics engine, so I
am getting a feel for it with this first before making something more serious.

The goal is to be able to use this the implement various graphics techniques,
such as shadow mapping, transparency, PBR, etc. 

I will be C++20, Vulkan as the graphics API, GLM for math stuff, and GLFW for 
windowing. 

Also, I am basing parts of this off of Travis Vroman's Kohi Engine and Brendan 
Galea's littleVulkanEngine. This is a rendering engine, so it should be
meaningfully different from the game engines I am basing off of
